# Zonal Food Trends in Nigeria (Power BI Analysis)

##  Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive analysis of food consumption trends across Nigeria's geopolitical zones** using data-driven insights. The analysis was carried out using **Power BI**, focusing on how different regions consume food and identifying the **most consumed food items** in each zone.

##  Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For cleaning, processing, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing the data.

##  Data Process
The following steps were followed in the analysis:
1. **Prepare** – Collected and structured data based on food consumption reports by zone.
2. **Process & Clean** – Removed inconsistencies and cleaned the data in Power BI.
3. **Analyze** – Identified top food items consumed in each zone.
4. **Visualize & Share** – Built interactive Power BI dashboards to explore and present insights.

##  Zones Analyzed
- **North West**
- **North East**
- **North Central**
- **South West**
- **South East**
- **South South**

##  Key Insights
- **Most consumed food item** in each of the six geopolitical zones.
- Comparative analysis of food preferences across zones.
- Visualization of food consumption patterns using charts and filters for exploration.

##  Purpose
To provide policymakers, nutrition analysts, and agribusiness stakeholders with actionable insights into **regional food consumption behaviors**, enabling **data-driven decisions** around food supply, distribution, and nutritional planning.

##  Example Dashboard Features
- Zonal filter (slicer) to view individual zone data.
- Bar charts ranking food items by consumption volume per zone.
- Summary KPIs showing top food items and total consumption by region.
